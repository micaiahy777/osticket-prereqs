To start off, I did not have the osTicket system on my computer, so I had to download everything on my Virtual Machine. The screenshot above shows the big picture of what I did to install this. It mainly consisted of opening/unzipping a bunch of folders, adding access to certain services, and just making sure I gave osTicket everything it needed to run since it requires certain prerequisites.

<p>
After all of the tedious work, I utilized IIS (Information Internet Services) to basically set up osTicket like I was apart of an organization to get familiarized with working day to day tickets.

After confiming that everything downloaded successfully, I can now set up, work, and complete tickets like I am working at a job from home!
